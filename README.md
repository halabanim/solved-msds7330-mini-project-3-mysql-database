<h1>MySQL Database</h1>

Question 1: Use the Sales Order Database and answer the following queries using MySQL Workbench. Submit screenshots of queries along with screenshots of results. If results are longer than one page then simply provide a number of rows returned from the query. Answers for the following queries:

<ol>

 <li>Display the customers who have never ordered bikes or tires. 2.      List the customers who have purchased a bike but not a helmet.</li>

 <li>Show me the customer orders that have a bike but do not have a helmet. Hint: This might seem to be the same as problem 2 above, but it is not. Solve it using EXISTS and NOT EXISTS.</li>

 <li>Display the customers and their orders that have a bike and a helmet in the same order. Hint: Solve this problem using EXISTS</li>

 <li>Show the vendors who sell accessories, car racks, and clothing. Hint: Solve this problem using IN.</li>

</ol>

Capture the sequence of queries and resulting output thereby demonstrating your database in operation. Turn in a pdf of your database in operation.

Question 2: Python – Write a Python Script that will connect to the Sales Order database and execute queries from question 1. The python script will connect to the MySQL database using MySQL connector and then you will execute the query using the cursor. To make it easier simply define the query at the beginning of the program.

Submit a complete python script.

Hint:

Import MySql connector

Define server name, user name, password

connect to the database  initialize cursor, execute query
